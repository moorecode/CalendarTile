# CalendarTile
![preview](https://github.com/moorecode/CalendarTile/blob/master/preview.png)


Simple Calendar tile that can display month, day of month and time of day. Intended use is for event reminders.

#How to use
CalendarTile has fully implemented @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable, simply set the class of as UIView to CalendarTile and you can modify its properties from the storybard.
The dimensions of the UIView should be 80x90, it is so not easy to change that but I can do it upon request.

There is also a convenience initialiser for creating a view in code.

Enjoy :)
